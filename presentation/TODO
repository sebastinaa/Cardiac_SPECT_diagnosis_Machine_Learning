>>front page containing SJCE logo - create another ppt with that as title page, then cut pdf and merge into this one

>>what SPECT IMAGES actually look like ? (put some image samples)
what is the input that we actually use?
where u got the data from? (website link)
what is training set ?
>>how u divide the input into cv set and test set ? why do u need this ? 
how many features ?
>>what are those features(bogus) ?

what is the training algo ?
>>how to choose best value of C and sigma in practice ?
what is linear kernel and gaussian kernel in svm ?
>>which kernel is better and why ?
>>put in some graphs of linear and non-linear kernel

what is the output ?
what is predictive accuracy, sesitivity, specificity ?

why did u choose svm? (becoz NN did not give accurate results)
		      (svm gives similar results everytime, but NN is
		      widely varying)
alternative prototypes tried (neural networks)
>>screen shot of accuracies of the two compared	

future improvements(multi-class classification, take age and sex into
	account , in general physical characteristics of patient)


create two seperate "svm_linear.m"	and   "svm_gaussian.m" to show the 
   difference
